INTRODUCTION

Given the high complexity and the levels of uncertainty at the time of determining certain
diseases to patients, it becomes necessary to undertake new searches in computational
technologies that allow the precise identification of the particular conditions of each person.
That is why predictive analysis, being a research branch, can help people improve their
physical and physiological integrity by knowing how likely they are to suffer from diseases in
the future.
There are alarming figures regarding heart disease worldwide, that is why the following work,
in addition to highlighting the importance of managing variables and characteristics of each
person, is seeking to exercise judgment to determine if a person will suffer of heart disease or
not. The previous work was destined to the exploration of variables and attributes of each
person and how these are essential for the creation of a predictive analysis model, in this work
that is presented below it aims to structure a decision tree model that I have the precision to
say without a person is prone to or not to suffer from the heart.
On the other hand, the great performance of each of the prediction models will be determined
by the skill of both the selection of variables and the handling of variables implicit in the model
and the selection of certain branches, all this under a statistical context. and taking into
account previous scientific research.
In addition, a comparison will be made between models and how they influence the results
obtained, accompanied by descriptive graphs which will consistently explain the structure of
the prediction
